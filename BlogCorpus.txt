The birch tree

They call it Foxwood Crescent.
Why, I don’t know. There aren’t any woods in the neighbourhood I grew up
in and definitely no foxes—just the occasional stray cat and the ditch that
flooded in the spring, full of tadpoles. Caleb and I used to play on the front
lawn, brandishing swords made of cardboard, pretending that we were
dashing through the undergrowth of the world’s greatest forest. We were
pirates, or thieves, or knights. The chalk mazes we drew up and down the
sidewalk became our realms. But in the end, when we stopped the game,
we were just two kids on the hot pavement, searching the neighbourhood
for something that wasn’t there.
I hear the echoes of our laughter on the day I return to Foxwood, and I still
remember that silence that fell when our imaginations finally ran out. It’s
like the moment after a sprint, when you double over, breathing hard, and
suddenly realize how still the world is.
Ten years later, I still remember. I spent the last decade studying abroad,
moving through foreign cities, trying desperately to avoid any reminders of

the life I left behind. I know that I was running. But when you tire of
fighting, that’s all you have left to do.
Caleb is already here when the cab drops me off at Foxwood, leaning
against the stone marker that displays the name of the neighbourhood, but
it takes me a second to realize that it’s actually him. He’s grown more than I
have in the past ten years, and is in desperate need of a haircut.
I grip the handle of my bag and start towards him. We meet beneath the
sign and I study him intently. Up close, he looks even more like a stranger.
His eyes have that same intensity as they did when he was a boy, but now
they are complemented by dark shadows and hollow cheeks.
Neither of us speaks for a long time, until Caleb clears his throat and says,
“Hey.”
“Hey.”
“You, uh…” He gestures to my bag. “You want me to carry that?”
“I’ve got it.”
“Right.”
“Thank you, though.”
There’s nothing else to look at, so my eyes drift up the neighbourhood sign
to the slogan. Foxwood: Where perfect lives begin.
It’s hard not to laugh.
Our life in Foxwood did begin perfectly, but childhood often has a habit of
appearing that way. Caleb and I were both born here, raised in the little
townhouse. We skinned our knees on the sidewalk out front, tumbled onto
the grass as we clumsily learned how to ride bikes, and ate dripping
popsicles on the porch with the sun beating down on us.
Dad often called us into the garage and taught us how to build model
airplanes and fix the tires on our bikes, or he opened the hood of the car
and let us look inside for as long as we wanted, smudging our fingers with
grease. In the summer, Mom showed us how to fertilize and tend to the
garden. We planted tomatoes, peppers, mint, and anything she could fit in
the little soil patch. By the time evening fell, all three of us were often
covered in dirt, grinning from the jokes and stories she told.

The garden belonged to Mom. That was why it was so strange when, on a
late spring day, Dad told me and Caleb to come outside, and presented us
with the sapling of a birch tree. When I asked him why he was suddenly
interested in gardening, he only looked at me with a strange expression.
We planted the birch tree in a dirt patch by the driveway. It was tiny and
frail, with delicate little leaves that looked like they might crumble away in a
gust of wind. We knelt on the grass, holding it up as Dad lowered it into the
ground.
“There,” he said. “This is for you to take care of, just like you have to take care
of each other. Every time you see it, remember that you also have to help
each other grow.”
He took our hands and guided them to the dirt, packing it down around the
birch tree.
“Understand?”
We didn’t, but we nodded. I remember wondering why he was telling us
that, and why he looked so sad, kneeling on the grass. But I didn’t ask, and
when the sun disappeared, we went inside to bed.
Late that night or early the next morning, I awoke to the sound of a car
engine. I climbed out of bed and pulled back my curtains to see Dad’s car
backing out of the driveway. I thought, for a moment, that he might look up
and wave at me. But he wasn’t facing forward, or looking over his shoulder
like he usually did when he drove in reverse. He was staring at the birch
tree.
I watched as his headlights slowly faded into the darkness beyond Foxwood,
and I stood there even after they disappeared, until I was too tired to stay
awake any longer.
The next morning I asked Mom where he had gone, and when he would
return. She just looked at me strangely and said, “Eat your breakfast, or
you’ll be late for school.”
I didn’t think much of it during the day, but when we returned from school
that afternoon and he still wasn’t home, I questioned my mother again.
When she brushed me off a second time, I shouted and screamed, and she
sent me to my room. I stayed there for hours, staring out the window at the
empty driveway, until someone knocked on my door.

It was Caleb.
“Come on,” he said. “We have to water the tree.”
That was the beginning, but it went on like that for years. The longer Dad
was gone, the worse it got. Mom withdrew from us almost entirely. She
stopped cooking, stopped cleaning, stopped packing our lunches or even
waking us up for school. While she used to read and paint and play the
piano, now she spent more and more time in her room, sometimes staying
there for days in the dark. The garden was overgrown. Caleb and I split up
what needed to be done, and we did it.
When the money started to run out, I picked up the phone and called our
grandmother, who we’d only met once. She seemed surprised to hear from
me. She didn’t offer to come over and help out, but when I explained the
situation to her, she sent us a cheque in the mail, and together, Caleb and I
did our first grocery run.
On top of school, which started to slip lower and lower on our list of
priorities, and attempting to keep the house running, we took care of the
tree. We watered it faithfully, checked it each day for damage, and
measured it at the end of every week. Caleb drove a stake into the ground
beside it to protect it from the wind, but after a year it was strong enough to
stand on its own. I’ll admit that we almost neglected it, but Caleb said, “We
have to take care of it. So it will be strong when Dad comes back.”
Looking back, it was strange how desperately we clung to that tree, to our
desire for it to grow. Somehow, I think we both believed that if the tree was
thriving, then we had hope for ourselves, too.
In the next few years, the branches spread out, thin but sturdy. In the spring,
the leaves became a canopy, glistening with dew in the morning sunlight,
and by evening, the white bark was bright against the falling dusk. No
matter the time or season, the birch tree always called our attention
towards it.
And it was perfect.
It was hard, but as we got older, we managed to scrape by as best we could.
Mom emerged from her room occasionally, and sometimes she even got
dressed and went out to meet with friends, but it was always followed by

days of darkness. No matter how much we begged and pleaded, she didn’t
even look at us. We were invisible.
So Caleb and I depended on each other instead.
The tree was taller than both of us by the time I was eleven, Caleb thirteen. I
don’t remember the exact date, but I’m sure I could check the hospital
records and find out. It was sometime in early August, and I walked upstairs
to our mother’s room with a tray of pasta that Caleb had made. I opened
the door, not bothering to say hello, and went to wake her.
I don’t remember it clearly.
It comes in flashes: I saw her on the ground beside the bed, surrounded by
orange bottles. I dropped the tray, and though it didn’t break, I heard a
tremendous shattering sound. The part I remember most vividly is my own
voice, screaming for Caleb.
After that there were phone calls, and sirens, and people asking me
questions I didn’t understand, and hours passed until I found myself on the
porch, with Caleb sleeping beside me. My grandmother was talking to me.
“… can stay with me,” she was saying. “But I can’t take both of you. They’ll
find a place for Caleb, I suppose…”
I wasn’t listening. The only thing I could focus on was the birch tree,
standing still and quiet amid the flashing lights of the police cars. I had
convinced myself that if we could just take care of it, if we could just make it
grow, then everything else would be okay, too. I stared at the perfection of
the branches, the strength of the trunk, the delicate curl of the leaves as
they taunted me. A bitter taste filled my mouth.
It had never been a promise. It was a farewell.
I shrugged Caleb off my shoulder and stood up, despite my grandmother’s
protests. I walked between the police cars to the shed, pulled out my
father’s old axe, and stalked towards the tree.
The first swing nearly tore my arm from its socket, but I didn’t stop. I didn’t
care that the handle sliced my palms or that the chips of broken bark flew
at my face. All I wanted was for the tree to match the rest of my life—to be
as damaged as we were.

Someone managed to stop me and wrestle the axe away. It must have been
Caleb. I remember sobbing into his shirt.
They put us in two different cars. My grandmother looked at me in the
rearview mirror. “You’re bleeding.”
I feel as if I’ve been bleeding ever since.
I feel it now, ten years later, as Caleb as I slowly walk up the hill towards the
house, our hands in our pockets. It’s the middle of the day, so the street is
mostly empty of cars, but there are children playing hopscotch on the
corner. One of them has a bleeding knee, but she doesn’t seem to notice.
“It’s changed,” Caleb says.
“So have we.”
Apparently, they couldn’t sell the house after our mother died. My
grandmother dealt with everything and left the property to me and Caleb
in the event of her own death, which was two weeks ago. I got the call in
the middle of my first class of the day, and I tried to convince the lawyer
that there was no need for me to actually be present for them to deal with
the house, but she said that it was up to Caleb and I to sort out the
contents. And so we returned.
We stand at the end of the driveway, which has long since been cracked by
the summer heat, and just look at the house. The gables are the same
colour, though the paint is peeling, and the streaked window panes still
appear to hold glimpses into our lives. I stare at my old bedroom window for
a long time, unable to shake the image of myself, sleepy and confused,
watching a car disappear.
“Look,” Caleb says, pointing to the lawn.
I didn’t notice it at first, but now my breath catches. The birch tree stands,
mangled, scarred, but tall and blooming with spring leaves. I start towards it
and stumble on the curb, my hands pressed against the scarred knots, and I
realize then.
I was wrong when I was a child, convincing myself that the perfection of the
tree could somehow balance the destruction of our lives. I was wrong when
I was older, too, and I tried to destroy it, thinking that the world could be
perfect or dead, and nothing else.

# brokenness, mental health
Imagine yourself in a gym, full of 12- and 13-year-olds,
running back and forth while dribbling a basketball.
Seems pretty simple, right? Well, that very simple exercise
was what sent me to the ER on my first ambulance ride. It
happened so fast. A classmate lost control of the ball, flew
up in the air, and landed smack on my head. Ouch! But I
kept on running. I was a small pre-teen; getting
accidentally hit by objects wasn’t anything new. Little did I
know that this was the beginning of a long medical and
emotional journey of learning what it means to be
supported by God and by others.
I kept running, trying to ignore the pain, but it was no use.
My head started throbbing. I had to stop, tears streaming
down my face I was ushered by some friends to my

down my face. I was ushered by some friends to my
teacher.
“Are you dizzy?”
“Does your neck hurt?”
“Do you want some ice?”
The days that followed were quite eventful. I had a panic
attack during my first trip to the hospital. My second trip
to the hospital was just two days later, because I looked
like I was going to faint. I was unable to sleep and I was
way more talkative than normal. The diagnosis was a mild
concussion.
About a week after I got bumped in the head, I went back
to school. I was looking forward to sharing my adventures
with my classmates, but barely anyone cared about what I
had to say. I found out that my sister had told a classmate
about my concussion, and she told the rest of my class. So
everyone already knew, end of the story. Except I was still
living through an ongoing story of headaches, fatigue, and
a lack of concentration. In the following months, I often
needed to go home early.
You can’t see a headache. Although my closest friends
may have cared about my well-being, I received very little
sympathy or support from my peers. I was just the girl who
was absent a lot.
I felt misunderstood and disappointed. It seemed as if
barely any of my classmates cared enough to listen.
Months after I got my concussion, four words rang
through my ears, causing my head to spin again:
“You will need surgery.”
I clenched my teeth as my heart struggled to maintain a
steady rhythm. I was ushered into another room.

“Surgery is big news, huh?”
I stayed quiet, blinking back any signs of fear that may
have come across my face. I just nodded my head in
agreement.
Shortly after, I was face to face with my friends.
All I told them was that I had “just” had a doctor’s
appointment.
Before I had my concussion, I found out I was diagnosed
with scoliosis. The need for surgery had nothing to do with
my concussion, which was contrary to what a lot of my
peers thought. When I found out about my diagnosis, I felt
embarrassed about the fact that I would need a brace at
night, and did not want to go into detail about my new
medical reality with my friends, because I feared what they
might think.
The following Labour Day weekend, a few months before
my surgery, there were unexpected and difficult moments
of heavy emotion. A housewarming party, seeing a friend
with cancer, and my sister’s sixteenth birthday party
completely overwhelmed me.
The next day was my first day of grade eight. So much had
happened that weekend. I was exhausted, and I walked
into school crying as if someone in my family had just
died. To make matters worse, most of my friends were not
in my class. I was silent and puffy eyed.
After lunch, I went to the next class on my schedule,
except when I knocked on the door, nobody answered. I
don’t know why, but I thought it was a good idea to
wander off into the field instead of going to the main

wander off into the field instead of going to the main
office for help. I was just walking, listening to music for
comfort. I even thought that nothing could hurt me. But I
was delusional.
Confusion hit me like a ton of bricks when someone
approached me, asking why I was in the field. I told her, “I
want them to be happy.” She looked at me, puzzled, then
brought me inside. To my astonishment, I’d been
wandering around in the field for hours; my parents were
worried sick.
I was ushered to the office to meet with my new vice
principal. He tried to understand what was going on.
Because it was the first day of school, he didn’t punish me
for essentially skipping class. So I gathered my things and
headed home. He was compassionate towards me, but
still, no one tried to understand my bizarre thoughts.
I was still not myself for quite some time. I needed
professional help. I was admitted to the psych ward of the
children’s hospital. When I was triaged, I claimed to know
people whom I’ve never met before. My parents could not
recognize their daughter.
After two weeks of being in the hospital, I was finally well
enough to go home. My whole experience, my odd
behaviour and thoughts, was summarized as me being
anxious about my upcoming back surgery. If you ask me,
that was an overgeneralization. My surgery was surely at
the back of my mind, but it all had to do with the fact that
I never really got the time to properly process each
individual thing that happened over the Labour Day
weekend. Looking back, I can say with confidence that at
least Jesus knew my situation at a time where I felt like no

one else did.
When I was preparing myself to go back to school, I was
given a way to explain my absence to my friends: I wasn’t
feeling well, so I went to the hospital. That’s it, no further
details.
When I went back to school, I remember a guy in my class
saying, “Oh I thought you were dead.”
What a welcome back to normal life. At least my friends
made it seem like they missed me.
Then came the questions.
“What happened to you? “
“Where were you?”
I told them what I’ve been advised to say: “I wasn’t feeling
well, so I went to the hospital.”
That wasn’t a sufficient answer. They felt entitled to know
more.
“Yeah, but what did you have?”
I repeated: “I wasn’t feeling well, so I went to the hospital.”
“Did it have anything to do with your heart?”
“No,” I replied, confused why they would ask.
Later, I discovered that there was a rumour going around
that I had a heart condition. When I told people that
wasn’t true, they would ask:
“Oh, then what did you have?”
“I don’t feel like talking about it.”
That seemed to quiet the questions—at least temporarily.
Eventually people found out that I needed surgery for my
back. Word spread among my teachers, and then to my
classmates. It wasn’t the ideal way to share the news with
my peers, but at least it took the pressure off my shoulders
to explain myself to others.

to explain myself to others.
I was back to my old self by the time the start of October
rolled around. I was afraid of slipping back into that mental
state where nothing I did or thought made sense. One
night in October I experienced chills, a sign that I had a
fever. My odd behaviour started to return, and I was once
again admitted to the psych ward, but this time, I had my
fever to blame.
Again, after a few weeks, I was better. I went back to
school. Again, I was given the same instructions from the
hospital about what to say to my peers about why I was
absent.
“Where were you?”
“I wasn’t feeling well, so I went to the hospital.”
“Yeah, but like, what did you have?”
“I had a fever.” Well at least that was the truth, just not the
whole truth.
I knew that people thought it was weird that I had a fever
for so long, but I didn’t let that bother me too much. Let
them be skeptical. I felt like myself again, and that should
be all that mattered. At least I had friends, like Farzana,
who showed that they really cared about my health.
I was supposed to have my spinal fusion surgery at the
end of October, but because of everything going on, it got
postponed to February.
When the time for my surgery came, I was nervous. I
remember my grandfather praying for me, and how

touched I felt. I woke up the morning of the surgery with
an encouraging email from one of my best friends,
Melanie. It served as a confidence boost for me. She wrote:
“Hi Amber,
I wanted to wish you luck on your surgery tomorrow. We
hope time goes by fast so you come back to school soon.”
Right before the surgery, my surgeon reassured me with
this: “I’ve performed this surgery many times. I know what
I’m doing.”
He couldn’t have said anything more comforting. I felt
ready to conquer whatever laid ahead of me. It was like
God was speaking to me directly through my surgeon; he
knew just what I needed to hear at that moment.
After my surgery, I felt very groggy, highly drugged with
pain meds. The pain didn’t quite register yet because the
pain meds had not worn off. But I was in for a rude
awakening. I was in for the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my
entire life. My mom was my rock. She was with me every
day in the hospital, present to assist my every need.
I remember getting another email from Melanie. Hearing
from her made me smile! She asked how my operation
was, when I would be coming back to school, and let me
know that everyone missed me. I even received a big card
from my class. It made me feel special and cared for that
they put so much thought and effort into a card just for
me. What a stark difference compared to how people
treated me when I got my concussion.
To be able to confide in a friend such as Melanie about my
experiences in the hospital felt like a weight off my
shoulders, because it made me feel like I wasn’t dealing
with my pain all alone.
When I went back to school, people asked me how I was
feeling, and this time, for the first time in months, I was
able to answer them honestly, holding nothing back. It felt
good to finally be completely free to share all my pain with

good to finally be completely free to share all my pain with
everyone.
Fast forward to a year or two, and my back felt significantly
better. I was progressing towards being fully healed. One
day, I found out that an old neighbour of mine was going
to have the same surgery. I felt for her. I wanted to give her
the comfort I had only dreamed of receiving.
I decided to message her:
It will probably be the worst excruciating pain you will
ever experience. It will be painful, but just know that the
pain will not last forever. Currently, about a year after I
had the surgery, I barely feel any pain, to the point where
me having had a surgery is not often at the forefront of
my mind.
She was thankful for me messaging her. It came in the
nick of time because she had the surgery shortly after. Talk
about perfect timing—God’s timing.
It’s hard to go through tough challenges when people
misunderstand your situation, especially those who should
know you the best. It’s especially scary when you yourself
can’t grasp what’s happening. For me, I really found
comfort in God, who knows me fully, and understands not
only my current situation, but also my future situations.
Although God’s comfort is more than enough to always
sustain me, the people who support me still matter, as
they are the ones who build me up when I feel
discouraged. So, telling my story is important because it
allows me to give others the support that I didn’t always
have

Living between two
cultures

# bible talk, community, relationships
Have you ever felt torn between different parts of who you
are?
As someone born in Canada to Filipino parents, living out
an identity stuck between two cultures has often felt like
being the rope pulled in a tug-of-war.
I grew up in the Filipino church community and with a big
Filipino family, surrounded by large family gatherings with
heaps of Filipino food. Karaoke was a staple at many
holiday parties, and we would often send money and
“balikbayan box” care packages back to family in the
Philippines.
At the same time, sixteen years of schooling in Canada
inevitably instilled in me Canadian values and practices,
whether participating in Canada Day celebrations or
cheering on Canada in the winter Olympics.
As a child, I never questioned my identity of being both

Filipino and Canadian.
But as I grew up, I realized I was more out of place in these
identities than I had thought. There were practices, ideas,
and values—in both Filipino and Canadian cultures—that I
didn’t follow, disagreed with, and sometimes even strongly
opposed.
It was because of these disagreements that I often felt
rejection from both cultures. I never quite felt like I had the
right to make myself at home in either culture.
And I am not alone. According to 2016 data from Statistics
Canada, over 40% of the Canadian population is identified
as part of the immigrant population—either having
migrated to Canada or being born to one or more
immigrant parents.
At a more individual level, at the heart of that statistic for
many immigrant Canadians is the desire to feel at home,
to belong.
On one hand, when you come to Canada or when you’re
raised in an immigrant community, you live with cultural
values and experiences that are different from North
American society.
On the other hand, the longer you live away from your
country of origin, the more you end up adopting ideas or
practices from the country you now live in.
I struggled with something that many first-generation and
second-generation immigrants realize after living in
Canada for a while: home doesn’t seem like one country or
the other anymore.
Instead, you find yourself living between two places, but
still yearning for “home,” even though you don’t know
what that looks like anymore.
But, while this constant longing for home has often felt
frustrating for me, it’s through that tension between
identities that God reveals to me again and again that the

gospel calls us to embrace and discover the beauty of

You find yourself living between two places, but still
yearning for “home,” even though you don’t know

The Bible is full of stories from the very beginning about
people who live between cultures.
The nomadic lives of Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph in the
book of Genesis, the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt to
find the elusive Promised Land, the siege and exile of Israel
by the Babylonians are all significant examples of a people
who faced rejection from different nations and felt a deep
longing for a home they didn’t know how to describe.
In the New Testament, the disciples left their families and
travelled all over Israel with Jesus. During the days of the
early church, Paul and his fellow apostles purposely put
themselves in places where they felt culturally out of place
in order to share the gospel.
Peter was told to eat culturally inappropriate foods in a
vision from God; Paul acted as mediator between Jews
and Gentiles; Philip was moved by the Spirit to share the
gospel with an Ethiopian eunuch.
God pushed the apostles into an uncomfortable space
between cultures, where they were called to bypass
cultural boundaries and move into a new cultural space.
I personally relate to that tension.
As a Filipina, because I was born in Canada, I often felt the
need to “prove” my Filipino identity to people, to justify
being part of the culture. I’ve been rejected by fellow

Filipinos and told that I can’t call myself Filipino for a
myriad of reasons, from not having full knowledge of the
Tagalog language to not adhering to certain cultural
expectations.
As a Canadian, I’ve heard stories of discrimination from my
community due to their immigrant status. In the past
decade, we’ve seen mainstream understanding of
Canadian history unravel as deep-seated racism against
Indigenous people rises to the surface. And as a result, I
know I can’t fully resonate with Canadian pride and
patriotism.
But, despite and even because of my misfit feelings in
both aspects of my identity, it’s in this space that I know
God can use me to minister to both communities, just like
Paul the Apostle.
It is through Paul that we can learn what it means to live
as a Christian between cultures. As a Roman citizen who
was also brought up in Jewish tradition, he utilized his “inbetweenness” to effectively engage people around him
with the gospel as much as possible:
“To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews.
To those under the law I became as one under the
law (though not being myself under the law) that I
might win those under the law. To those outside the
law I became as one outside the law (not being
outside the law of God but under the law of Christ)
that I might win those outside the law.”
— 1 Corinthians 9:20-21
Throughout his ministry, he navigated the biggest
intercultural conflict of the early church: joining together
Jews and Gentiles.

Undeniably, it was because he was immersed in both
cultures that he could have clout in this conflict, from
calling fellow apostles out on their rejection of Gentiles to
dispensing wisdom on how the calling to the gospel
transcends culture.
Paul was living proof that God can use the experiences of
people who live in between cultures to speak gospel truth.
And the beauty in Paul’s experience is that he didn’t let his
ministry get bogged down by the cultural prejudices of
the people he served, because he recognized a greater
truth.
Our identity in Christ is worth far more than our identity in
any earthly culture. At the same time, this doesn’t mean
we’re meant to abandon our cultural roots!
Through the gospel, we can see both the brokenness and
the beauty that God sees in the different cultures he has
called us to partake in.

Even with the unease within my identity, to a certain
extent, I can appreciate aspects of my Filipino-Canadian
identity.
I find joy in the togetherness of celebrating Canadian
accomplishment on a global scale, like Raptors
championships, and food-filled parties with my big Filipino
family—all celebrations reminiscent of the global church
family gatherings to come with my heavenly Father.

Paul didn’t simply tell Jews and Gentiles to abandon their
culture to take part in the salvation of the gospel. He told
the church to see the vision of the gospel beyond their
cultural differences—a vision of a global church of all
cultures. This is a vision described in Revelation 7:9-10:
“After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude
that no one could number, from every nation, from
all tribes and peoples and languages, standing
before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in
white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and
crying out with a loud voice, ‘Salvation belongs to
our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!’’’
It’s through the gospel that we can see how God calls us to
an amazing identity, one that is rooted in the gospel—a
gospel that saves people of all tribes, tongues, and nations,
a gospel that celebrates each culture in the ways it can
reflect him, a gospel that redeems the parts of cultures
that are broken by sin.
For sure, there are times I may feel rejection and
abandonment in both cultures I was born into. But, like
Paul, I’m learning to remember that my true identity and
self-worth are found in Christ—and, in the future, in my
true home.
The journey to find home has always seemed long,
arduous, and unending for those who follow God.
But, it was exactly how God meant it to be, because our
home was never meant to be in this world. Hebrews 11
summarizes it best:
“These all died in faith, not having received the
things promised, but having seen them and greeted
them from afar, and having acknowledged that they
were strangers and exiles on earth. For people who
speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a
homeland.
If they had been thinking of that land from which
they had gone out they would have had

they had gone out, they would have had
opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a
better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God
is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has
prepared for them a city.”
— Hebrews 11:13-16
Life on earth has always been only a shadow of someplace
better, a taste of what is to come for those who love God
and yearn for a home. So, naturally, discomfort in the
present day is a part of living in the expectation of a
glorious home beyond this life.
To step in between cultures, to hope and long for a
home that transcends our understanding—this is the
call of the gospel for God’s people.
The journey to find home has always seemed long,
arduous, and unending for those who follow God.
It’s definitely not a comfortable place to be in. Yet, the
calling of the gospel isn’t a call to be comfortable, to fit
into the cultural moulds of this world.
It’s a call to make the same sacrificial journey Paul did, a
journey Christ took for us—to glorify God by bringing
people home.
I may never feel quite at home in the cultural spaces of
this world.
But, I have hope and comfort in realizing my home isn’t
here at all.
My home is in the gospel that takes us in when no one
else does, in the Saviour who accepts us for who we are no
matter what, and in the future of a glorious reunion with
him—and with my fellow Christ-followers of all tribes,
tongues, and nations.
