Abstract
Purpose – This study aims to examine how reward expectancy mediates the effect of abusive
supervision on organizational citizenship behavior. Furthermore, drawing upon regulatory focus
theory, this paper proposes and tests the moderating role of promotion focus in the proposed mediating
effect.
Design/methodology/approach – Both hierarchical regression and PROCESS macro are conducted to
analyze longitudinal data collected from 142 MBA students in different industries in the People’s Republic of
China.
Findings – Results reveal that abusive supervision was negatively related to both organizationdirected citizenship behavior (OCBO) and individual-directed citizenship behavior (OCBI) through
undermining individual reward expectancies. Results also show that promotion focus moderated the
negative effect of abusive supervision on reward expectancy, such that the relationship was stronger
when promotion focus was higher. In addition, the indirect effect of abusive supervision on OCBO and
OCBI carried through reward expectancy was also stronger among individuals with higher promotion
focus.
Originality/value – It contributes to the literature on abusive supervision by offering a new perspective
regarding the mechanism of abusive supervision influence on organizational citizenship behavior. The
findings thus shed insights into cognitions and motivations that are associated with organizational
citizenship behavior. In addition, it is the first to link abusive supervision with regulatory focus theory to
examine the decrease of organizational citizenship behavior.

Paper type Research paper
Abusive supervision, which is defined as “subordinates’ perceptions of the extent to
which supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and non-verbal
behaviors, excluding physical contact” (Tepper, 2000, p. 178), has attracted increasing
attention from scholars (see for reviews, Mackey et al., 2017; Tepper, 2007). Taking the
form of ignoring, ridiculing, insulting, threatening, undermining subordinates or
violating their privacy, abusive supervision has been reported to produce a range of
negative consequences. For example, abusive supervision is positively associated with
subordinates’ deviant behavior in the workplace (Lian et al., 2012; Tepper et al., 2009,
2008). Abusive supervision has also been found to have a negative influence on
organizational citizenship behavior (Aryee et al., 2007; Zellars et al., 2002) and job
performance (Harris et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2014; Shoss et al., 2013). Abusive supervision
was estimated to have caused an annual cost of $23.8bn in the USA (Tepper et al., 2006).
While employees may respond to abusive supervision by engaging in deviant behavior
(Lian et al., 2012) or performing poorly at the job (Shoss et al., 2013), more often they may feel
obligated to meet the performance and behavioral standards expected of them should they
want to stay in their current post. Under such circumstances, employees may tend to reduce
their organizational citizenship behavior (Zellars et al., 2002). Task performance refers to
behaviors directed toward formal tasks, responsibilities and duties such as those listed in
the job description (Williams and Anderson, 1991), whereas OCB refers to voluntary acts
that go beyond formal job requirements and contributes to organizational effectiveness
(Organ, 1988; Riketta, 2002).
Following the convention (Riketta, 2002; Williams and Anderson, 1991), we include both
organization-targeted OCB (OCBO) and individual-targeted OCB (OCBI) in representing
subordinates’ OCB. OCBO refers to behaviors which benefit the organization as a whole (e.g.
conforming to regulations and giving advice), and OCBI refers to behaviors that directly
benefit specific individuals (e.g. helping coworkers). We theorize that both types of OCB be
affected by abusive supervision through reward expectancy. Reward expectancy is defined
as perceived likelihood of gaining material rewards offered by the organization that are
matched with their contributions (Vroom, 1964). We choose OCB over task performance
because compared to task performance, OCB is more at the discretion of the employees and
thus should be more strongly affected by their experiences (e.g. leader treatment) and
perceptions (e.g. reward expectancy) at work. In addition, OCB such as being a good citizen
supporting the organizational agenda is also less likely to be constrained by individuals’
capability and formal work roles, as it would be in the case of performing formal tasks.
Our study aims to contribute to the literature on abusive supervision in two main ways.
First, research explaining how abusive supervision negatively affect employees’ OCB has
primarily focused on the mediating role of subordinates’ justice perceptions, such as procedural
justice (Zellars et al., 2002) and interactional justice (Aryee et al., 2007; Rafferty and Restubog,
2011). Studies have also examined how perceived social exchange relationship with the
supervisor may link abusive supervision to lower levels of OCB (Liu and Wang, 2013; Peng
et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2012). Extending the existing work that has examined the exchange and
justice mechanisms as accounting for the influence of abusive supervision on OCB, we draw
from the expectancy theory to propose and test the mediating role of reward expectancy.
Unlike existing work that emphasizes the perceived relational or moral implications of leader
abusive treatment, our focus on reward expectancy takes a more instrumental and
motivational lens to understand the effect of abusive supervision. As such, our study offers a
relatively unattended channel through which abusive supervision may affect employees’ OCB.
Second, we further examine the moderating effect of promotion focus in the relationship
between abusive supervision and reward expectancy. Regulatory focus contains two
different foci: the promotion focus and the prevention focus. While the motivations behind
prevention focus are security, safety and non-losses, promotion focus is defined by an
orientation toward growth, advancement and achievement (Higgins, 1997). We propose that
the relationships of abusive supervision with reward expectancy and in turn with OCB
should be stronger for individuals with higher promotion focus. This is because strong
tendency to focus on personal gains and achievement (i.e. high promotion focus) motivates
individuals to readily relate abusive supervision to concerns about their opportunities to be
rewarded and to advance in the organization. These concerns can be reflected in reward

expectancy, which reflects the perceived likelihood to be rewarded through contributing to
the organization such as by exhibiting OCBs.
To summarize, we propose a model in which abusive supervision is linked to employees’
OCB through perceptions of reward expectancy. In addition, we theorize that the negative
relationship between abusive supervision and reward expectancy is particularly strong
among high promotion-focused employees. Our findings thus shed insights into the
cognitions and motivations that are associated with engaging in OCB, an important
employee behavior that is critical to the success of the organizations (Koys, 2001; Podsakoff
et al., 1997; Podsakoff and Mackenzie, 1997).
Theory and hypothesis
Abusive supervision and organizational citizenship behavior
Studies have consistently reported a negative relationship between abusive supervision and
OCB (Aryee et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2014; Zellars et al., 2002). For example, Zellars et al. (2002)
found that abusive supervision hinders OCB directly or indirectly through reducing
perceptions of procedural justice, which refers to the idea of fairness in the processes that
resolve disputes and allocate resources (Thibaut and Walker, 1975). In another study, Aryee
et al. (2007) reported that abusive supervision was negatively associated with both types of
OCB (i.e. OCBI and OCBO) through interactional justice, the perception of the degree to
which the people affected by decision are treated by dignity and respect (Bies, 1986). Other
studies which were carried out in Chinese context examined how the quality of social
exchange relationship between the subordinate and the supervisor may explain the negative
influence of abusive supervision on OCB (Liu and Wang, 2013; Peng et al., 2014; Xu et al.,
2012). Xu et al. (2012), for example, showed that abusive supervision negatively affected
OCBO and OCBI through lowering leader–member exchange relationship (LMX). In
summary, studies have primarily focused on justice perceptions (Aryee et al., 2007; Zellars
et al., 2002) and LMX (Peng et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2012) as the mechanisms that account for
the negative abusive supervision–OCB relationship. In the following section, we introduce
the expectancy theory on which we base our hypothesis concerning the mediating role of
reward expectancy in the relationship between abusive supervision and OCB.
Mediating role of reward expectancy
The expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964) states that the extent to which an individual is
motivated to perform certain task depends on the perceived contingency between the effort
devoted to the task and the corresponding performance (expectancy I, or E1), and the
perceived contingency between performance and reward (expectancy II, or E2). Here, we
focus on the second linkage, which is termed reward expectancy (Sims and Szilagyi, 1975).
In the workplace, reward expectancy refers to the expectation that an improvement in
performance and contribution to the organization will be matched by an increase in reward.
Reward expectancy is different from distributive justice in that it focuses on one’s
anticipation of being rewarded and therefore is more forward-looking and motivational in
nature. Specifically, reward expectancy concerns about the specific association between
one’s own change in performance and corresponding change in rewards, whereas
distributive justice is a judgement of the equity of one’s output in relation to one’s input
(Adams and Freedman, 1976). Thus, perceptions of distributive justice also often involve
social comparisons with others, but reward expectancy primarily focuses on one’s own
performance change. Compared to distributive justice, higher reward expectancy may
readily motivate employees’ effort to enhance their contributions to the organization.

When employees experience silence, ridicule and vituperation from supervisors, they may
hold that supervisors will not give them a fair evaluation based on their performance and
contributions. That is, their performance will be underrated by their abusive leaders.
Consequently, victims of higher levels of abusive supervision may perceive lower reward
expectancy than their colleagues who receive lesser amount of abuse. Moreover, abusive
supervision erodes employees’ trust in the organization (Rafferty and Restubog, 2011). Victims
may infer from their mistreatment by the leader as having a negative influence on their chances
to be rewarded proportionally to their contributions. As such, they may perceive that their
higher contributions to the organization will not be fairly rewarded. Based on the reasoning
above, we hold that individuals under abusive supervision have low reward expectancy.
Reward expectancy in turn affects employee motivation and behavior at work (Isaac
et al., 2001). Empirical researches have consistently showed that reward expectancy had a
positive effect on effort and task performance (Keller and Szilagyi, 1976; Podsakoff et al.,
1982; Sims and Szilagyi, 1975). While existing studies have chiefly focused on task
performance, we argue that a higher reward expectancy should also motivate more OCB
that contributes to the organizational effectiveness. This is because OCB, in addition to task
performance, contributes to performance evaluation and reward recommendations (Allen
and Rush, 1998; Kiker and Motowidlo, 1999; Werner, 1994). Specifically, managers often
include OCB as part of performance evaluation of their employees. For example, Allen and
Rush (1998) found that supervisors had more interpersonal liking toward subordinates who
performed more OCB. As a result, the supervisors would provide those subordinates a
higher overall evaluation and a stronger reward recommendation. Similarly, Kiker and
Motowidlo (1999) found that both task performance and contextual performance (a concept
overlapped with OCB) were rewarded (a promotion or a fast-track development program),
and that two types of performance interacted to influence supervisors’ reward decision.
Given the way supervisors make performance evaluation and reward recommendation,
employees may also conceptualize performance as including both task performance and
OCB. In line with this reasoning, Morrison (1994) found that employees often consider
citizenship behaviors as expected by their managers. Thus, we argue that employees would
view OCB as a component of the “performance” or contribution on which their rewards are
based. Therefore, lower reward expectancy should reduce OCB. As we noted earlier,
compared to reducing task performance, withdrawing citizenship behaviors (e.g. guiding the
work of colleagues, attending non-required organizational functions and offering
constructive suggestions) may also be a relatively safer and volitional choice. The reasoning
above leads us to argue that employees will engage in less OCBO and OCBI when they have
lower reward expectancy. Indirect empirical support may be found among studies that have
reported a positive effect of contingent reward (i.e. leader reward behaviors that are
contingent on subordinates’ performance) on follower OCB. In their meta-analysis, Podsakoff
et al. (2006) reported a positive association between leader contingent reward and all five
forms of employee citizenship behavior (altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship,
courtesy and civic virtue), with effect sizes ranging from 0.09 (civic virtue) to 0.17 (courtesy).
In summary, we propose that abusive supervision will have a negative influence on
reward expectancy, which, in turn, will be positively associated with OCBO and OCBI. Our
first set of hypotheses is as follows:
H1a. Abusive supervision is negatively related to OCBO as mediated by reward
expectancy.
H1b. Abusive supervision is negatively related to OCBI as mediated by reward
expectancy.

Moderating effects of promotion focus
Higgins (1997) proposed the regulatory focus theory, which differentiates self-regulation
with a promotion focus from self-regulation with a prevention focus. Promotion focus and
prevention focus are independent, which means that individuals can be either high or low
with regard to attention to both foci (Higgins, 1997). People with a promotion focus are
motivated by growth, advancement and achievement and they attempt to align their actual
selves with their ideal selves (self-standards based on wishes and aspirations), whereas
security and obligation motivate people with more of a prevention focus and they strive to
coincide with their ought selves (self-standards based on duties). Because promotion focus
concerns about one’s sensitivity to potential gains and rewards (Brockner and Higgins, 2001;
Higgins, 1997), we expect this regulatory focus (vs prevention focus) to moderate the linkage
between abusive supervision and reward expectancy.
Individuals with high promotion focus possess strong achievement and advancement
motivation, namely, they pay much attention to praise, reward and improvement. When
they experience criticism, insults or ridicule, which are contrary to their value, they would
more readily concern how these negative leader treatments may signal their potential
opportunities to be rewarded in the organization. As such, they may perceive a much lower
reward expectancy, compared to those with lower level of promotion focus. In addition, high
promotion-focused individuals, compared to low promotion individuals, may be easily
demotivated by the abusive leader behaviors, which constitute a sharp contrast with their
typical desire for praises and recognition. In other words, their reward expectancy declines,
on account that recognition of the supervisor begets or signals work rewards such as pay
raise and promotion. Thus, we argue that a higher promotion focus will exacerbate the
negative relationship between abusive supervision and reward expectancy:
H2. Promotion focus will moderate the negative relationship between abusive
supervision and reward expectancy, such that the relationship will be stronger
when the promotion focus is higher.
Because abusive supervision is hypothesized to be related to OCBO and OCBI indirectly
through reward expectancy (H1a-H1b) and that promotion focus is expected to moderate the
relationship between abusive supervision and reward expectancy (H2), it suggests that the
negative indirect effects of abusive supervision on OCBO and OCBI through reward
expectancy will be stronger when promotion focus is higher (vs lower). Therefore, we
propose below a moderated mediation hypothesis (Preacher et al., 2007):
H3a. Promotion focus will moderate the indirect influence of abusive supervision on
OCBO through reward expectancy, such that the indirect relationship will be
stronger when promotion focus is higher.
H3b. Promotion focus will moderate the indirect influence of abusive supervision on
OCBI through reward expectancy, such that the indirect relationship will be
stronger when promotion focus is higher.
Methods
Sampling and procedure
The data were a part of a larger research effort. Only one study variable (i.e. OCBI) was used
in the other published paper (authors not disclosed for the anonymous review process),
which includes this data set as one out of its two study samples. The theories and research
questions between the two studies are also very different. A total of 484 full-time working

MBA students in a southern province of China were invited to participate in our study. At
the beginning of the research, participants were informed that all the data were used only for
this academic study and that no benefits or penalty would be associated with their decision
to participate as well as with the information they submitted. The first survey was
conducted in the last week of March 2015 and the second survey at the end of April 2015. We
sent out the questionnaires and pens to the participants and asked them to return back
before the class starts. To protect participant privacy and guarantee the efficacy of this
longitudinal research project, participants created their own unique ID numbers at Time 1
and were asked to keep their ID numbers throughout the research, including at the times of
both the first and the second surveys. This study ID number was then used to match the
information of surveys across the two waves of students assessed.
Among the 484 MBA students approached, 259 completed the first survey, and 243
finished the second survey. We finally matched 142 participants who finished the two-wave
survey and whose ID numbers were valid throughout the research. Among the 142 samples
that were efficient and were used in our final analysis, 55 per cent were male and 65 per cent
were in a managerial position. The average age of the participants was 30.7 years (SD = 4.3)
and their average period of tenure in their organizations was 6.1 years (SD = 4.2).
Measures
To test the interaction between abusive supervision and promotion focus on reward
expectancy over a month, demographic variables and independent variables (i.e. abusive
supervision and promotion focus) were measured at Time 1, and dependent variables (i.e.
reward expectancy, OCBO and OCBI) were measured at both Time 1 and Time 2. But, all the
data of dependent variables (i.e. reward expectancy, OCBO and OCBI) were from Time 2. All
the items were rated by subordinates.
As the original scales used were developed in English, all the items were translated into
Chinese following a back-translation approach (Brislin et al., 1973).
Abusive supervision. We used seven items from the abusive supervision scale originally
developed by Tepper (2000). These seven items have been validated by other researchers
who used a shorter version of abusive supervision scale (Hannah et al., 2013; Peng et al.,
2014). Respondents rated the frequency with which their supervisors engaged in the
behavior described in each of the seven items, using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = never,
3 = sometimes and 5 = almost always). Items included: “My leader puts me down in front of
others” and “My leader expresses anger at me when they are angry for another reason.” The
alpha reliability of this measure was 0.87.
Promotion focus. We selected four items for promotion scale from the nine-item scale
developed by Lockwood et al. (2002). The sample item for promotion scale was “I often
imagine myself experiencing good things that I hope will happen to me.” Participants
responded to these four items on a seven-point Likert-type scale from 1 (never) to 7 (almost
always). The alpha reliability of this measure was 0.92.
Reward expectancy. Participants were asked to report their expectation of being
rewarded over the past month in their current organization. Participants reported on four
items from the reward expectancy scale using a five-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at all,
3 = somewhat and 5 = a great deal). Two items were from House and Dessler (1974) (also see
Sims et al., 1976) to measure the perceived linkage between effort and rewards. Because we
emphasize tangible material rewards in our study, we excluded items that referenced to
respect and recognition by others. These two items focus on promotion and pay increase,
which are the most frequently used forms of work rewards. The other two items that

developed by Eisenberger et al. (1997). These two types of rewards are gaining popularity in
Chinese organizations. The four items were: “As my performance increases my chances for
higher pay increases,” “As my performance increases my chances for promotion increases,”
“Doing a better job results in more opportunities for advancement” and “If I do better job I
will be rewarded with more fringe benefits.” This measure showed good internal reliability
(a = 0.92).
OCBO. We used the four-item civic virtue subscale from the OCB measure developed by
Podsakoff et al. (1990) to measure the civic virtue dimension of OCB. Participants were
asked to report on the frequency at which the four situations occurred. Two sample items of
those four situations were: “Attends meetings that are not mandatory, but are considered
important” and “Attends functions that are not required, but help the company image.” The
alpha reliability of this measure was 0.91.
OCBI. The altruism dimension, which includes five items, from the OCB scale developed
by Podsakoff et al. (1990) was used to measure OCBI. Participants were asked to report on
the frequency at which the five situations occurred. Two sample items were “Willingly help
others who have work related problems” and “Is always ready to lend a helping hand to
those around me.” Alpha reliability for this measure was 0.86.
Control variables. We originally controlled for gender, organizational tenure and
organizational identification and prevention focus that might confuse the results throughout
the analysis (we excluded age as a control variable because it has a high correlation with
tenure in our sample [r = 0.70], and it was not significantly related to the dependent variable
when tenure was controlled in the analysis). The results showed no significant difference
when these control variables were not included. Following the suggestion by Carlson and
Wu (2012), we therefore reported the analyses that did not include these control variables.
In a set of supplementary analyses reported later, we controlled for prevention focus and
organizational identification. Four items were selected from the nine-item scale developed by
Lockwood et al. (2002) to measure prevention focus at Time 1. The sample item for
prevention focus scale was “I am anxious that I will fall short of my responsibilities and
obligations.” The alpha reliability of this measure was 0.78. Organizational identification
was measured by five items developed by Mael and Ashforth (1992). A sample item was
“When someone criticizes my organization, it feels like a personal insult.” It was rated by the
participants at Time 2 and the alpha reliability was 0.86.
Results
Confirmatory factor analysis and descriptive analysis
We conducted confirmatory factor analyses in AMOS 20.0 to test the measurement model of
the study variables, which include abusive supervision (seven items), promotion focus (four
items), reward expectancy (four items), OCBO (four items) and OCBI (five items). First, we
tested the hypothesized five-factor model in which each of the 24 items loaded on its
corresponding construct. This model showed adequate fit statistics (x
2
(252) = 435.87, p <
0.001, CFI = 0.91, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.07). We compared this model to the three
alternative models in which the factor correlation between a pair of constructs (e.g. OCBO
and OCBI) was fixed to unity. Results showed that our hypothesized measurement model
outperformed all of the three alternative models.
Table I summarizes the descriptive statistics, zero-order correlations and the reliabilities
of the study variables. Notwithstanding the mean of abusive supervision being low (mean =
1.61), it is compatible with the means reported in the published studies (Tepper et al., 2008;
Zellars et al., 2002).
Test of moderation effects
We conducted a hierarchical regression analysis to test our moderation hypotheses. Table II
summarized the results of H2, which concerned the interaction between abusive supervision
and promotion focus on reward expectancy. According to H2, the interactive effect of
abusive supervision and high promotion focus was significant in predicting reward
expectancy (b = 0.24, p < 0.01). This significant interaction was plotted in Figure 1. It
shows that abusive supervision was not significantly related to reward expectancy when
promotion focus was low (simple slope t-test = 0.23, ns). On the contrary, there was a
significant negative relationship between abusive supervision and reward expectancy
(simple slope t-test = 5.30, p <0.01) when the promotion focus was high. Thus, H2 was
supported (Figure 2).
Test of mediation and moderated mediation effects
Both the mediation hypothesis (H1a and H1b) and the moderated mediation hypothesis
(H3a and H3b) were tested using the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013). To determine the
statistical significance of each indirect effect, a 95 per cent bias-corrected bootstrapped
confidence interval (“CI”, hereafter) was obtained. The results for the indirect and
conditional indirect effects are presented in Table III.
H1a-H1b predicts that subordinates’ reward expectancy mediates the influence of
abusive supervision on OCBO and OCBI, respectively. In the regression model concerning OCBO as the dependent variable, the 95 per cent CI of the indirect effect excluded zero
(effect = 0.16, CI = [0.33, 0.05]). Results thus showed significant indirect effect on
OCBO as mediated by reward expectancy, lending support to H1a. Similarly, the indirect
effect of abusive supervision on OCBI through reward expectancy was also significant
(effect = 0.08, CI = [0.18, 0.03]). H1b was therefore also supported.
In the moderated mediation test, we examined the conditional indirect effects of abusive
supervision at both high (i.e. mean þ SD) and low (i.e. Mean – SD) values of the moderator
(promotion focus). Results showed that the indirect effect of abusive supervision on OCBO
through reward expectancy was significant when promotion focus was high, with the 95
per cent CI excluding zero (effect = 0.30, CI = [0.55, 0.14]). However, the indirect effect
was not significant when promotion focus was low (effect = 0.02, CI = [0.17, 0.14]). The
same pattern of findings was observed for OCBI. Specifically, the indirect effect of abusive
supervision on OCBI through reward expectancy was significant when the promotion focus
was high (effect = 0.16, CI = [0.31, 0.05]), but the indirect effect was not significant
when the promotion focus was low (effect = 0.01, CI = [0.08, 0.10]).

Supplementary analyses
Supplementary analyses were conducted to:
 examine the moderating role of prevention focus; and
 rule out the possibility that organizational identification may fully account the
mediating effect we observed regarding reward expectancy.
First of all, while Higgins (1997) theorized that promotion focus and prevention focus are two
independent constructs, in other words, individuals can enjoy a high promotion focus and
high prevention focus at the same time, empirical studies often reported a negative
relationship between these two constructs (Brockner and Higgins, 2001). We therefore
controlled for prevention focus in testing the interaction effect of promotion focus in a
supplementary analysis. In this analysis, we also explored the interaction between
prevention focus and abusive supervision. As reported in Table II (see Step 3), the interaction
involving prevention focus was not significant (b = 0.09, ns). In addition, our hypothesized
interaction between promotion focus and abusive supervision remained significant (b =
0.22, p < 0.01). Results thus are in line with the conceptualization of prevention focus and
promotion focus as two independent dimensions (vs the opposite ends of one dimension).
Second, studies have shown that organizational identification explained the influence of
abusive supervision on OCB and ethical behaviors that benefit the organization (Hannah et al.,
2013). In another supplementary analysis, we controlled for organizational identification to
examine whether reward expectancy explained the variance in OCB over and beyond
organizational identification. As reported in Table III (see M3), reward expectancy was
significantly related to both OCBO (b = 0.26, p < 0.01) and OCBI (b = 0.24, p < 0.01), after
controlling for organizational identification. As reported in Table IV, as with the findings
reported in testing our hypothesis, the mediation effect of reward expectancy on the OCB
variables remained significant. The findings regarding the moderated mediation effects also
remained the same (Table IV). To summarize, the supplementary analyses showed that reward
expectancy accounts for the negative effect of abusive supervision on OCBO and OCBI, even
after controlling for the mediating effect of organizational identification.
Discussion
We examined how abusive supervision affects subordinates’ expectations that they will be
rewarded in ways that affect their OCBO as well as OCBI and the effect of promotion focus
on the connections between them. Previous researches have already reported the negative
relationship between abusive supervision and OCBO and OCBI. We extended this literature
by developing and supporting a model in which abusive supervision influences OCBO and
OCBI through a novel reward expectancy mechanism. Besides, we investigated a new
dispositional variable, promotion focus, of which the effects have not yet been explored
under abusive supervision. These findings, and their implications for future research and
practice, are discussed below.
Theoretical implications
Our findings extend preceding studies in suggesting that abusive supervision undermines
subordinates’ reward expectancy and then reduces OCBO and OCBI. This pathway is new
in abusive supervision literature and warrants future research. Our findings reached an
agreement with Lian et al. (2002), who found that abusive supervision has a negative effect
on subordinates’ perceived likelihood of rewards. We hold that abusive supervision reduces
reward expectancy of subordinates, because it undermines employees’ trust in supervisor
about giving evaluation impartially and belief in the organization of the chances to be
rewarded fairly (Tepper, 2000). Researches have pointed out that employees regard high
OCB as a way to gain rewards (Allen and Rush, 1998; Kiker and Motowidlo, 1999).
Employees who feel a low performance-reward contingency, which means they will not be
rewarded even though they perform well, would withdraw OCBO and OCBI.
The interactive impact of abusive supervision and promotion focus on reward
expectancy, which has not been explored previously, indicates that once high promotionfocused employees suffer abusive supervision, they would lower their expectancies of
rewards. The indirect effect of the interaction between abusive supervision and promotion
focus on OCBO and OCBI through reward expectancy also indicates that for individuals
with high promotion focus, the more abusive supervision they perceive, the more they will
be demotivated, as supervisors’ abusive behaviors stand for no recognition which are vital
for pay raise and promotion recommendation, then they would not be disposed to participate
in OCBO and OCBI.
Practical implications
Our findings, which suggest that abusive supervision have harmful effects on employees’
OCBO and OCBI through damaging reward expectancy and that promotion focus can
moderate these relationships, lead to implications for management practice. First, it is disbeneficial for organizations to indulge in abusive supervision due to the high hidden costs
thereof. To reduce thus the detrimental effects, managers are required to be educated and
aware of the various detrimental effects of abusive behavior, such as the decline in task
performance (Harris et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2014; Shoss et al., 2013) and OCB (Aryee et al.,
2007; Ouyang et al., 2015; Zellars et al., 2002), as well the increase in deviant behaviors (Lian
et al., 2012; Tepper et al., 2009, 2008). It is also essential for organizations to train their
supervisors and improve their managerial competence and skills. A work shift or even a
suspension should be given to those who remain incorrigible or unqualified.
Second, taking the mediating role of reward expectancy into account, organizations need
to declare some norms and rules such that rewards are rendered in accordance with
individuals’ performance and exceptions are not allowed. We suppose it can mitigate the
negative effects to some degree. In addition, senior managers should set an example to

supervisors in conforming to organizational regulations to create an atmosphere of fairness,
which can augment the trust of employees in their supervisors concerning performancebased rewards. As it had been proved that the behavior of superior managers positively
affected that of middle managers and first-line managers, once those in power engage in
abusive behaviors, administrators acquire the trait and follow suite given the opportunity
(Liu et al., 2012; Mawritz et al., 2012). On the contrary, they will administer rewards matched
with subordinates’ performance when authorities manifest it more.
At length, our research proposes that individuals with higher promotion focus would be
more likely to perceive lower reward expectancy as a result of their abuse by the supervisor,
and consequently withdraw OCBO and OCBI. Managers thus may need to realize the
significant negative consequences of abusive supervision on promotion-focused employees
who also tend to exhibit more creativity and high performance (Friedman and Forster, 2001;
Neubert et al., 2008). Moreover, it is rewarding for organizations to place employees with
high promotion focus in situations that match their advancement motives, for example,
express words such as aspirations and wishes frequently to them. Therefore, promotionfocused individuals will be motivated to bring more positive outcomes.
Limitations and future research
There are some limitations that ought to be acknowledged in our study. To begin with, our
questionnaire recovery rate was low due to the two-wave matching problem. We sent out
484 questionnaires in two periods, and received 259 by Time 1, and 243 by Time 2, so we
eventually matched just 142 participants. Besides, our data were all collected from one
source. Especially, we just obtained organizational citizenship behavior data from
participants, rather than their supervisors, and individuals tend to report higher than their
actual scores on it. Nevertheless, in future, research should use an adequate number of
samples to check the present findings.
A second limitation is that we did not include other variables that would influence OCBO
and OCBI, which were pointed out by previous investigations. That is to say, there might be
other causes leading to employees’ withdrawal of OCBO and OCBI and not just abusive
supervision. Nonetheless, the reverse inducement of abusive supervision has been verified.
We argue that future studies can control other variables, which are related to OCBO and
OCBI.
We only tested our model in China, which has a high power distance and strong
collectivism (Aryee et al., 2007) and this is the final limitation. The generalizability of our
findings needs further attention, as it has been proposed that the magnitude of outcomes
stemming from abusive supervision will be distinct in different cultures (Tepper, 2007). Of
course, there are also numerous published studies drawing similar conclusions in diverse
cultural settings. Hence, prospective researchers can conduct similar work in both Confucian
cultures and Western cultures.
Conclusion
We found that reward expectancy partially accounted for the negative effects of abusive
supervision on employees’ OCBO and OCBI, and promotion focus played a moderating role
between those relationships. Specifically, promotion focus exacerbated the negative effect of
abusive supervision on reward expectancy and the interaction of high promotion focus and
abusive supervision exerted a negative influence on OCBO and OCBI through diminishing
reward expectancy. Our findings are vital as they offer a novel perspective from which to
comprehend how abusive supervision acts on OCBO and OCBI, and the work integrates
